### Project Overview:
Retail Recommender is a comprehensive recommendation system designed to analyze user behavior and preferences, and provide highly accurate and personalized product recommendations. Leveraging advanced data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and visualization tools, the system ensures a deep understanding of customer interactions with the retail platform.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** A robust preprocessing pipeline ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis. From handling missing values to encoding categorical variables, no stone is left unturned in preparing the data for further exploration.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into the data with interactive EDA tools. Uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights that lay the foundation for powerful recommendation strategies.

3. **Data Visualization:** Transforming complex data into intuitive visualizations, a compelling way to understand customer behavior is offered. From scatter plots to heatmaps, visualizations provide actionable insights at a glance.

4. **Association Rule Learning:** The heart of the system lies in Association Rule Learning, where associations between products are mined to uncover meaningful patterns. By setting appropriate thresholds for **support, confidence, and lift**, high-quality rules are extracted to drive the recommendation engine.
